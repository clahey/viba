Viba
====

Viba is a virtual contra dance band.  It takes tune files and
generates music.  The eventual goal of the project is to be the band
for a contra dance.

It currently can read two different formats.  The older one is an xml
file that points to the output of hand made lilypond files.  This is
not very useful.  The second format is a subset of MusicXML.  It
currently will handle tunes with a proper repeated A and then repeated
B of the right length.  The repository contains 2 MusicXML files that
it can handle.

To try it out, install a bunch of packages on your machine (I'll make
a list of packages soon.  An important one is fluid-soundfont-gm.)
Then run the standard autoreconf, configure, make series and run
src/viba.

Currently known bugs
====================

Every so often, a note in the melody seems to be skipped.
